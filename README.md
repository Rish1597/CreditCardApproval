# Credit Card Approval Prediction

#### Problem Statment

A Commercial bank wants to automate the Credit Card eligibility process based on customer detail provided while filling online application form & Credit history of customers.

Banks receive a lot of applications for issuance of credit cards. Many of them rejected for many reasons, like high-loan balances, low-income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual’s credit report. Manually analyzing these applications is error-prone and a time-consuming process. This task can be automated with the power of machine learning, In this project, we will be build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, just like the real banks do.

This business challenge is to identify the customers segments which are eligible for Credit Card approval, so that they can specifically target these customers.


#### Addressing- Businees Issues
In contrast to other projects, the definition of "eligible" or "not eligible" is not provided, thus we will create a machine learning model to predict whether an applicant is an "eligible" or "not eligible" customer for a credit card. To create our label, we will analyze the datasets. We will also attempt to address the significant issue of unbalanced data in this work in order to develop a more accurate predictive model.

1.First, we will start off by loading and viewing the datasets.

2.We will see that the datasets have a mixture of both numerical and non-numerical features, that it contains values from different ranges, plus that it contains a number of missing entries.

3.We will have to preprocess the dataset to ensure the machine learning model we choose can make good predictions.

4.After our data is in good shape, we will do some exploratory data analysis to build our intuitions.

5.Finally, we will build the best machine learning model that can predict if an individual's application for a credit card will be accepted by understanding a good or bad applicant.
